# Due to fatigue wasnot able to do something useful in the code
# just drawn some ui stuff.
# deleted the atomorg.cpp file 
# loaded a list icon for the game.
# learned to only focus on programming while programming and not allow my brain to
## ruminate those principles that are already coded in my head by heart.
## because I kept watching them again and again. Don't ruminate your intuition will 
## automatically apply those principles while you'll be working on the programming.
